# 100 Days Of Coding
Hi, I'm Francesca! :) 

As a fresher AI student, I decided to take on this challenge to become a better version of myself and broaden my horizons! 

In recent months I have realized that the best way to learn how to code is actually to sit down and code. This sounds much easier than it actually is because for a true beginner is very frustrating to accept that the critical part of coding is making mistakes and learning how to debug a code (which can take very long). 

In my case, I want to get very good at coding in Python. \
Therefore, I decided to take this path and share my progress "live", step by step, to motivate myself first of all and those who want to start something new in their lives. Good luck, and remember: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
