    madlib= f"Once upon a time there lived a very sad banana named {name_1} . {name_1} lived in a box in Fruitsville and was sad because had no friends.\
        But then {name_1} thought, <<How am I going to get friends if I don't go looking for some? I am going to go out and look for some friends.>>\
        So {name_1} put on {object_1} to impress people and went out to {place_1}. \
        {name_1} was walking around {place_1} when appeared a nice banana called {name_2}. \
        She said, <<Hello, my name is {name_2}. Do you want to go to {place_2}, and go on the {object_2}? >>\
        {name_1} said, <<OK, If you will be my friend.>> <<Yes!>> {name_2} replied. So {name_1} and {name_2} became good friends and {name_1} wasn't sad anymore.\
        Later on they got married and had 3 little bananas called {baby_1}, {baby_2} and {baby_3}. And they all lived happily ever after."
